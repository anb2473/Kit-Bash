ok. So my plan for building this entire system will be as follows: 1. build async module to ensure that the window size is always valid, 2. run the compose function of the app and quickly generate a keybinding map explaining how bindings should be structured. From there 3. create an async module constantly updating the focused widget and everything. once thats done 4. we begin working on rendering
